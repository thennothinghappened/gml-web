 Complete rewrite of my much earlier project, the equally uncreatively named [gamemaker-http-server](https://github.com/thennothinghappened/gamemaker-http-server). Modelled *heavily* after ExpressJS - though in a much worse and less secure form. Should go without saying not to try and use this for something important, but it's still cool, right.....???
